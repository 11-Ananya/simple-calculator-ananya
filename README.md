Here’s a simple and clear README for your Python calculator script:

🧮 Simple Calculator
📘 Overview
This is a basic command-line calculator written in Python.
It performs simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division between two numbers entered by the user.

🚀 How It Works
The program prompts the user to input two numbers.

The user is then asked to select an operation:

+ for addition

- for subtraction

* for multiplication

/ for division

The calculator performs the chosen operation and displays the result.

If an invalid choice is entered, it prints "invalid choice".

💻 Example Usage
enter number: 10
enter number: 5
enter your choice +,-,*,/: *
50
🧩 Code
a = int(input("enter number"))
b = int(input("enter number"))
choice = input("enter your choice +,-,*,/")

if choice == "+":
    print(a + b)
elif choice == "-":
    print(a - b)
elif choice == "*":
    print(a * b)
elif choice == "/":
    print(a / b)
else:
    print("invalid choice")
⚙️ Requirements

No additional libraries are required.

📄 License
